CAUTION: *The information and processes in this README are being brainstormed and discussed. 
They have not been implemented!*

But speaking of brainstorming, we're looking for people to add some *thunder and lightning*!

Do you have ideas about how to: 

* automate documentation so code and references stay up-to-date?
* flag and tag documents according to versions?
* link source code to documents across repositories?
* outline and structure user-friendly manuals?
* write, edit, automate, deploy, etc. documentation?

If so, don't hesitate to file an issue, start a wikipage, fork this repo, or join the discussion *link pending* on the mailing list.

== Overview

The Asciidoctor Documentation project's goal is to build, store, and distribute the content relevant to the Asciidoctor organization and its projects.

This repository will store and maintain the:

* General documentation guidelines
* General document building instructions
* Asciidoctor Organization documents (such as the {infra-ref}[Infrastructure Goals and Planning] document)
* {templates-ref}[Content guides and templates] for writing READMEs, changelogs, manuals, tutorials, etc.
* Source code for building documents that include content from multiple repositories
* Writer's guide
* General contributor manual
* General developer guidelines
* FAQ
* Tutorials (which will be released to the website)
* Additional learning materials (presentations, etc.) that are cross-repository
* Project collateral

Additionally, the Asciidoctor Documentation repository will distribute each project's documentation for publication on the Asciidoctor website.
It will build additional and alternate forms of documentation from content and code flagged and included throughout the repositories.

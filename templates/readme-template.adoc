= README Template
Sarah White

CAUTION: This template is not finalized! It is a working draft, and it would love your input!

The README is the minimum amount of documentation that is packaged with a gem or project.
It is also part of the project's landing page on GitHub.

*Audience* 

All levels of users and developers

*Writing style*

The README should be concisely written.
However, it should be compelling and informative, as it will be the first document describing what your project does that many potential users will see.

* Make sure to define terms and acronyms.
